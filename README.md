import pandas as pd

# Create sample data
data = {'x': np.arange(1, 11), 'y': np.array([1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100])}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Apply square root transformation
df['new_x'] = np.sqrt(df['x'])

print(df)
```

Output:
```
    x   y     new_x
0   1   1  1.000000
1   2   4  1.414214
2   3   9  1.732051
3   4  16  2.000000

6   7  49  2.645751
7   8  64  2.828427
8   9  81  3.000000
9  10 100  3.162278
```

### Data Normalization

- **Objective**: To standardize numerical features, making different features comparable and improving convergence speed in certain algorithms.

- **Methods**: Common techniques include min-max scaling to put values within a range, and z-score to standardize to a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.

- **Implementation**: It's usually applied to numerical features, although some algorithms and models require normalization of categorical variables as well.

#### Code Example: Data Normalization

Here is the Python code:

```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler

# Create data
data = {'age': [25, 38, 50, 45, 20, 37], 'income': [50000, 80000, 100000, 90000, 30000, 75000]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Initialize the Scaler
scaler = MinMaxScaler()

# Fit and transform the data
df[['age', 'income']] = scaler.fit_transform(df[['age', 'income']])

print(df)
```

Output:
```
        age    income
0  0.031250  0.142857
1  0.375000  0.500000
2  0.687500  0.857143
3  0.562500  0.642857
4  0.000000  0.000000
5  0.354167  0.428571
```
<br>

## 13. What are the techniques for _data reduction_ in the context of _data mining_?

**Data reduction** intends to streamline datasets, making them easier to handle and more nuanced in their insights.

### Techniques for Data Reduction

#### Dimensionality Reduction

- Techniques like **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** minimize information loss by consolidating correlated columns.
    
- Function: $X' = X \cdot W$, where $W$ has the top eigenvectors of the covariance matrix.

#### Numerosity Reduction

- **Binning or Histogramming**: Data grouped into bins to represent a range of values with a single value, thus reducing dataset size.
    
- **Clustering**: Variants like k-means can summarize similar data points while retaining key characteristics.

#### Distortion-Based Reduction

- **Regression**: Uses the relationship between variables to find a reduced representation, e.g., linear regression predicting the target variable using independent ones.
    
- **Discretization**: Converts continuous variables into a set of intervals. This simplification minimizes precision while maintaining the general trends in the data.

#### Density-Based Methods

- **Cluster Pruning**: Eliminates data points in small clusters believed to be noise, thus reducing dataset size without significant information loss.

#### Transformations

- **Aggregation**: Combines multiple records into a single summary metric, leading to a more compact dataset.
    
- **Normalization and Standardization**: Scales values to a smaller range, ensuring all variables contribute more equally in certain analyses.

#### Feature Selection

- **Filter Methods**: Using statistical tests like ANOVA, the aim is to select features based on their relationship to the target variable.
    
- **Wrapper Methods**: Algorithms select the best features for a particular predictive model based on their contribution; examples include recursive feature elimination (RFE).
    
- **Embedded Methods**: These selection techniques are integrated within the chosen predictive model, e.g., LASSO regularization.

#### Data Cube Aggregation

- Minimizes data points in multi-dimensional datasets through aggregation along various axes.

### Code Example: Principal Component Analysis

Here is the Python code:

```python
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA
import numpy as np

# Generate sample data
data = np.random.randn(100, 4)
# Initialize PCA
pca = PCA(n_components=2)
# Fit and transform the data
reduced_data = pca.fit_transform(data)
```
<br>

## 14. How do you handle _missing values_ in a _dataset_?

**Missing data**, though common in real-world datasets, can pose significant challenges for machine learning algorithms. Here are some strategies to handle them.

### Techniques for Managing Missing Data

#### Listwise Deletion

Listwise deletion, a straightforward method, involves **removing entire rows** that contain missing values. While this approach is simple, it can lead to loss of valuable data, especially if missingness is spread across multiple columns within the same row. This can result in reduced model accuracy and statistical power.

#### Pairwise Deletion

Pairwise deletion, instead of removing the entire observation, removes individual pairwise (column-wise) missing values from the analysis. This allows for the utilization of available data and therefore, can be more efficient than Listwise Deletion. 

#### Imputation

**Imputation** techniques replace the missing values with estimates, making the dataset more complete. Common imputation strategies include:

   - **Mean/Median Imputation**: Replace missing values in a feature with the mean or median of non-missing values in that feature.
   
   - **Mode Imputation**: Applicable for categorical data, mode imputation replaces missing values with the most frequent category.
   
   - **Regression Imputation**: This approach infers the missing values in a column based on other columns. For example, in a regression model, one column with missing values can be treated as the dependent variable while the rest of the columns are treated as independent variables.
   
   - **K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN) Imputation**: Missing values are estimated by using the corresponding values in other data points, where closeness is defined by distance measures like Euclidean or Manhattan distance.

   - **Multiple Imputation**: Multiple imputation generates several imputations for each missing value. The analysis is then performed on each dataset, combining the results accurately.

### Code Example: Imputation Using Scikit-Learn

Here is the Python code:

```python
from sklearn.impute import SimpleImputer
import pandas as pd

# Load dataset with missing values
# For simplicity, let's assume 'dataset' is already loaded

# Initialize the SimpleImputer
imputer = SimpleImputer(strategy='mean')

# The fit_transform method imputes missing values and transforms the dataset
imputed_data = pd.DataFrame(imputer.fit_transform(dataset), columns=dataset.columns)
```

In the code above, `SimpleImputer` is used with the `mean` strategy to replace missing values with the mean of non-missing values in each column. Other strategies such as `median` or `most_frequent` are also available.
<br>

## 15. What are the methods for _outlier detection_ during _data preprocessing_?

**Outlier detection** is a crucial step in data preprocessing, essential for ensuring the quality and accuracy of your machine learning models. Here are some commonly used techniques:

### Univariate and Multivariate Methods

#### Box-and-Whisker Plots
Visualize the spread of data across various quantiles of a distribution, particularly identifying any datapoints that lie beyond $1.5 \times IQR$ from the quartiles.

#### Z-Score
Compute the number of standard deviations a data point deviates from the mean. Points beyond a certain threshold are often flagged as outliers, frequently set at $3$ standard deviations.

#### Modified Z-Score
Similar to Z-Score, but using the median rather than the mean and a threshold, such as $3.5$, to flag outliers.

#### Mahalanobis Distance
Consider both the mean and the covariance of the data, calculating the distance of each point from the centroid. This technique is especially useful when the features are correlated, enhancing multivariate outlier detection.

### Proximity-Based Methods

#### K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN)
Flags data points with fewest neighbors within a certain distance, as defined by the number of neighbors $k$.

#### Local Outlier Factor (LOF)
Calculates the local density of points by comparing the density around a point to the densities of its neighbors. Points with a substantially lower density might be outliers.

### Clustering Techniques

#### DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)
Identifies core samples of high-density data and extends clusters from them. Points not in any cluster are marked as 'noise,' which are essentially the outliers.

#### Isolation Forest
Constructs a forest of random trees and isolates the outliers. The number of partitions required to single out an instance serves as a measure of its abnormality.

#### Mean Shift
Finds areas of "high density" within a feature space defined as the area containing a relatively large number of data points' aiming to find and move points towards the modes of the distribution.

#### One-Class SVM
A type of support vector machine that is trained using only the inliers. It then uses a decision boundary to identify outliers in the test data.

#### Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs)
Models the density of the data using a **mixture** of multiple Gaussian distributions. By analyzing which Gaussian distribution a data point is more likely to have originated from, the method can detect unusual observations.

### Visualization Methods

#### Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
Projects the high-dimensional data onto a lower-dimensional space, making it possible to identify outliers visually.

#### T-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)
Also known as t-SNE, this technique reduces the dimensionality of the data while maintaining a focus on preserving local structures. It's mainly used for visualization but can help spot outliers.

### Statistical and Historical Approaches

#### Time-based Outlier Detection
Especially useful for temporal data, where unusual values occur at specific times. Deviations from the expected values or trends at these times mark the data points as outliers.

#### Grubbs' Test
Commonly used in quality control procedures, it's a parametric test to identify an outlier in a univariate dataset.
